## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Twitter(X)
-bookmarking tweets to read later
-retweetting to spread information further

Instagram 
-Posting images 
-Discovery feed

YouTube
-Search feature (can search for anything!)
-Making your own YouTube playlist (watch later playlist)

I would want to build an app around soccer(football). The app can have a discovery feed for new things happening in the world of 
soccer such as breaking news, transfer updates, etc. I want the user to be able to sort of bookmark certain teams or players to 
get the latest information on them. There can be pictures/videos of the players whether that be on or off the field.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The biggest challenge was getting used to a whole new workplace. This is my first time using any of these applications and first 
time using swift.

Aside from that making the gif was also a bit difficult because it was my first time making one.
